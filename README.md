# Reader

This is the companion repository to my foray into building a feed reader service for myself. It's built with the following stack

- Http4K
- Jetbrains Exposed
- HikariCP for connection pooling
- H2 Database for testing
- Postgres Database for deployments

You can find the write-up for the motivations and process and of course discription of the project on the blog post
